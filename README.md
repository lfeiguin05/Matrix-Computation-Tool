# Matrix-Computation-Tool
Linear algebra matrix computation tool in python that uses gaussian elimination function that logs steps to perform various linear algebra computations. These include determinants, such as an LU decomposition determinant with a Laplace expansion fallback version, a eigenvalue/vector solver, and an SVD calculator. The tool also includes many other matrix functions, such as multiplication, add/subtract, matrix inverse, and a transpose. The main issues and areas of improvement lie in eliminating floating point errors, and speed. Since this mostly in pure python, the projects speed is not ideal.
