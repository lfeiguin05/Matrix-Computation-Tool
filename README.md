# Matrix-Computation-Tool
Linear algebra matrix computation tool in python that uses gaussian elimination function that logs steps to perform various linear algebra computations. These include determinants, such as an LU decomposition determinant with a Laplace expansion fallback version, a eigenvalue/vector solver, and an SVD calculator.
